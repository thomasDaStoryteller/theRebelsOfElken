            The campaign runs on four resistance tracks and one pressure track.
          </p>

          <div className="track-list">
            <div className="track-item">
              <strong>Hope</strong> → The morale of the common people and their
              willingness to support the resistance.
            </div>
            <div className="track-item">
              <strong>Unity</strong> → The coordination, trust, and discipline
              of the resistance cells.
            </div>
            <div className="track-item">
              <strong>Secrecy</strong> → How well the resistance hides from the
              Guard's surveillance and informants.
            </div>
            <div className="track-item">
              <strong>Resources</strong> → A spendable currency (supplies, gold,
              information, goodwill). Used to give bonuses or unlock special
              missions.
            </div>
            <div className="track-item pressure">
              <strong>Oppression</strong> → A pressure track that always rises
              steadily as the city's regime tightens control. It's the ticking
              clock of the campaign.

            <div className="resource-use">
              <strong>Inspiration (Hope boost)</strong> → Each player may reroll

            <div className="resource-use">
              <strong>Coordination (Unity boost)</strong> → Once during the
              mission, a player may take an extra action surge OR reposition
              allies strategically.

            <li>Some missions require resources upfront.</li>
            <li>
              These missions are usually more powerful and provide greater
              benefits.

              Example: rallying the Union might require spending 2 resources to
              organize safely.

            <li>
              <strong>Partial success</strong> → Some progress, smaller bonuses
              or mixed effects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Failure</strong> → Resistance suffers consequences.

              <strong>Abandoned</strong> → No outcome, but time still passes and

          <p>
            The endgame is a large-scale uprising against the authoritarian
            regime.
          </p>

          <h3>When it triggers:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Players can choose to launch the assault if Hope, Unity, and
              Secrecy are strong enough.
            </li>
            <li>
              If Oppression maxes out, the assault is forced — but under much
              harsher conditions.

            <div className="assault-effect">
              <strong>Unity:</strong> Better coordination of cells, tactical

            <div className="assault-effect">
              <strong>Secrecy:</strong> More options for surprise strikes,

            <div className="assault-effect">

              If the party takes too long, oppression grows worse (the Guard
              commits atrocities, public support wanes).
